This repository acts as collection of static pages created for my HighSchool Web Design course. 

All of these sites are hosted [Here](https://hpaulson.github.io/web-design/).

NOTE: I am in no way a web designer. My css skills are extreamly poor, and these pages are mostly unresponsive on mobile and other screen sizes. We ended up not actually building more than one site in my class, so this repository only contains one project.
